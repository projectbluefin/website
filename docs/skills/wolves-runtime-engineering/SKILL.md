# Wolves runtime engineering

## Overview

Gate engineering work on the frozen Wolves runtime.

## When to Use

Use only when the user explicitly authorizes overlay, transport, fullscreen, or
YouTube IFrame engineering.

## When NOT to Use

Do not use for routine content or unapproved visual work.

## Core Process

1. Confirm explicit approval.
2. Read `../../reference/wolves-runtime.md` and
   `../../architecture/runtime-data-flow.md`.
3. Preserve store ownership and player-clock synchronization.
4. Reuse the existing YouTube API loader.
5. Check async cancellation and fullscreen containing blocks.
6. Verify in Chromium and with relevant tests.

Do not introduce a second transport or wall-clock synchronization.

## Red Flags

- Content work is used to justify component or style changes.
- A fullscreen overlay lacks the required containing-block treatment.
- A second YouTube API loader or transport is introduced.
- Browser bounds and player states are not checked.

## Verification

- [ ] Explicit approval exists.
- [ ] Relevant unit tests pass.
- [ ] Typecheck and build pass.
- [ ] Chromium checks cover bounds and controls.
- [ ] Production deployment follows the validation skill.

## References

- `../../reference/wolves-runtime.md`
- `../../architecture/runtime-data-flow.md`
- `../design-gate/SKILL.md`

## Timing lessons

- Keep scheduler and renderer on one content-cost timing model.
- Preserve locked anchors and recompute only unlocked intervals.
- Prefer invariant tests over stale exact timestamps for recomputed intervals.
- A build is not runtime proof; verify the real Wolves route in Chromium at short/long records and locked anchors.
- Never describe a discarded experiment as restored or complete.
